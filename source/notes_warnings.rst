Use Notes and Warnings
######################

Use notes and warnings to make a sentence stand out visually.

In |RST|, you specify notes and warnings through directives (the ``..`` syntax).

Notes
*******

.. note::
  This is note text. Use a note for information you want the user to pay
  particular attention to.
  
  If note text runs over a line, make sure the lines wrap and are indented to
  the same level as the note tag. If formatting is incorrect, part of the note
  might not render in the HTML output.

  Notes can have more than one paragraph. Successive paragraphs must indent to
  the same level as the rest of the note.

This is how the note appears in RST:

.. code-block:: RST

Warnings
***********

.. warning::
    This is warning text. Use a warning for information the user must
    understand to avoid negative consequences.
    
    Warnings are formatted in the same way as notes. In the same way, lines
    must be broken and indented under the warning tag.
